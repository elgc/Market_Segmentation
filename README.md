# Customer segmentation
## RFM Customer Segmentation with Clustering

- Market segmentation is the process of dividing a consumer market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics.
- RFM analysis is a data driven customer behavior segmentation technique.
- RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (Sales in this example).
- The  idea is to segment customers based on when their last purchase was (Recency), how often they’ve purchased in the past (Frequency), and how much they’ve spent overall (Sales). All three of these measures are effective predictors of a customer's willingness to engage in marketing messages and offers.

The data used is from a company that offers delivery services. Customers are grouped using **cluster analysis** and the final result is a table with purchasing behaviors:

|Groups| Recency	| Frequency  | Sales    |   Purchasing behavior  |
|------|----------|------------|----------|------------------------|
|  0	 |  704.89	|      2.31	 |     1.78 |      Low Value         |
|  1	 |  406.28	|      4.19	 |     3.54 |      Low Value         |
|  2	 |   98.18	|     61.95	 |    43.05 |      Medium value      |
|  3	 |   17.64	|  1,593.64	 | 1,336.73 |      Medium Value      |
|  4	 |    0.89	|  3,495.45	 | 2,395.86 |      Medium Value      |
|  5	 |    0.00	|  6,025.00	 | 5,734.55 |      High Value        |
|  6	 |    0.00	| 12,412.33	 | 8,490.50 |      High value        |

**Cluster analysis** is a statistical method used to group similar objects into respective categories. It is also known as segmentation analysis, taxonomy analysis, or clustering. When these groups are clearly defined, a marketing team can target clusters of customers with cluster with tailored, targeted strategies.
